# Code-Challenge
A node.js tic-tac-toe game. Clone and start two tabs with localhost:3000

##

This challenge was supposed to take an hour. I have spent more than two hours to get to this point. 

Game still does not detect the winner, properly. - Bad

It is possible to have Player 1 start early, before Player 2 has joined and use a square that the game does not show after Player 2 joins - Bad

Other unsightly things occur that can be cleaned up.

It is time to hang my head and turn in what I have. Once I give them time to assess, I will return to the code and finish it right. - It has to be done and really not too much left to do.
